MBTA - Public agency responsible for most public transportation
Subway, Commuter Rail, Bus, The Ride, and Ferry
The Ride - door to door shared ride paratransit
58 Cities/towns in greater Boston area 5 AM - 1 Am
Apply and be approved by The Ride Eligibility Center (TREC)
Schedule 1-7 days in advance

Companies that run the vehicles: 
Greater Lynn Senior Services
Veterans Transportation Services
National Express
All dispatched through The Ride Access center, centralized call and dispatch center

Old Model
FY2017 - $109 Million, delivered 1.8 Million trips for 33K customers
Avg cost per trip = $35 (MBTA pay this much)
Customer pay flat fee: $3.15 or $5.25 depending on location area
Vendors paid per trip model
Vendors have specific region and share the core area
Vendors responsible for their call center/schedule/dispatch
Low amounts of ride-sharing - want to improve this
Transfer points for region changes

New Model
Reduce costs for FY2018
Global Contact Service responsible for running a centralized call/dispatch center
Vendors paid in per revenue hour model: First pickup to last drop off
GCS responsible for providing an optimized schedule for vendors
Vendors responsible to deliver trips
Pay cars on standby “SLACK TIME”, because it's The Rides responsibility to find rides. (30%)
⅔ of vehicles are handicap accessible - do not consider this in optimization

Other Initiatives
On Demand Paratransit Pilot with Uber/Lyft
Pilots available to all Ride customers (call-in option)
Customer pays first $2, the MBTA pays next $13, the customer pays the remainder of the trip cost
Oct 17 - The Ride start new pilot with Verifone, allows customers to use taxis in the coverage area in same way
Lyft or Uber pays for deadhead time
Do not need a smartphone, can call in to dispatcher and they will dispatch a Lyft for you
Not replacing old fleet, just lower costs and give customers other alternatives if they want to try

Want Minimized number of vehicles to deliver all the needed trips
Maximized number of trips for the time frame

New Challenge
Given the new revenue hour model and alternative service, which trips should be allocated to each provider in order to have a lower overall cost and maximize MBTA’s vehicles productivity.

Read a daily set of schedule trips and customer info
Input Data Fields with: date, time, pickup, and drop off info, notes, RIDE ID, and Trip Id
Optimize routes using dedicated and non-dedicated vehicles
Output trip manifest for each individual route in the core service plus a file with schedule trips for non-dedicated provider(taxi) (EX. Vehicle 1 picks up X at address 1 and drop off z) .csv file

Who runs this system:
Runs from: in a server in GCS separately, not integrated complete with Adapt Software

Operational questions 
What percentage cancels/recurring cancels - 10-15%


Input Data:
1 day of the Ride schedule trips (5000 trips)

Goals:
Minimize cost
Maximize RIDE vehicles productivity (rides/hour)
Maximize number of shared rides
Fix issue with dispatcher needing to solve delayed rides - make it a software question

Costs:
Ride Vehicles are $50/hour
Taxi cost, use BPD info

Extra:
Compare individual trip cost with Uber/Lyft cost - No Surge
Work with an API from our Taxi partner platform (Verifone) to automate the process
